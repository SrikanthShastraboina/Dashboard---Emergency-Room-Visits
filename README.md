# Hospital Emergency Room Visits Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing and visualizing data related to emergency room (ER) visits at a hospital. The analysis focuses on key metrics such as patient wait times, admission rates, average satisfaction scores, and patient visit trends over time. The insights are presented in a dashboard format for improved decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Project Contents

### 1. Data Sources
- **`Dashboard-Emergency Room Visits.pdf`**: Contains the visualization and summarized metrics of the ER data, including trends, patient details, and operational KPIs.
- **`Hospital ER_Hospital ER.csv`**: A dataset with detailed records of ER visits, including patient demographics, timestamps, and outcomes.

### 2. Key Metrics
The analysis captures:
- **Total Patients**: `2,295` visits recorded.
  - **Admitted**: `49.2%`
  - **Not Admitted**: `50.8%`
- **Average Patient Satisfaction Score**: `5.5/10`
- **Average Wait Time**: `35.3 minutes`
- **Percentage of Patients Seen Within 30 Minutes**:
  - **Within Target**: `40.2%`
  - **Missed Target**: `59.8%`
- **Trend Analysis**:
  - Significant fluctuation in patient volumes across months.
  - Peak traffic observed during certain months.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
```bash
- Tableau (or compatible visualization tool) for dashboard interactions.
- Python, R, or SQL for data preprocessing and analysis.
```
### Steps
```bash
1. Data Preparation:
   - Load the CSV dataset and preprocess it (cleaning, handling missing values, etc.).
   - Extract metrics for the dashboard.

2. Dashboard Customization:
   - Use the provided PDF as a reference to replicate or enhance the dashboard.
   - Apply additional filters or features as necessary.

3. Analysis:
   - Generate insights from the data for key stakeholders.
   - Export visualizations or reports as required.

## Outcomes and Insights
```bash
- Operational Bottlenecks:
  - High percentage of patients not seen within 30 minutes indicates potential inefficiencies.
  - Variation in patient volumes requires dynamic resource planning.
- Patient Experience:
  - Moderate satisfaction scores suggest room for improvement in service quality.
```

## Future Work
```bash
- Integrate predictive analytics for patient flow and wait times.
- Expand the dashboard to include financial impacts and staff efficiency.
- Automate data ingestion and real-time reporting.
